## Regarding Software and Roadmap

The ethos and intent of Firn is still developing. Contributions are welcome, but
until a more readily-available roadmap exists, you may wish to consider opening
an issue or to ask questions in the Discord channel before starting a large
contribution/patch.

With that said, these things come to my mind when I am building Firn.

- Cover the first 75% of the more popular features of org-mode, and cover more
  niche features later.
- Stay close to rendering plaintext/html. Avoid JavaScript and Frontend bloat.
- Make it extensible with a small core.


## Regarding Being a person who uses Firn

 - Be kind.
 - Feature requests will be considered but there is 0% guarantee it will be integrated into the project.
