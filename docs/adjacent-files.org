#+FIRN_UNDER: Content "The Render Function"

*Purpose:* This document explains how to render links to "adjacent files" based on
the ~#+FIRN_ORDER~ frontmatter.

*Prerequistes*: an understanding of [[file:the-render-function.org][The Render Function]], [[file:layout.org][layouts]], [[file:front-matter.org][front matter]].

* Overview

In some cases, you may wish to indicate what the "next" and "previous" page may
be on your Firn site (such as linking to a previous blog post) - /adjacent files/
accomplish this.

Constructing "adjacent files" requires your files to be using either the
~#+FIRN_ORDER~ (for sorting based on a numeric order) or the ~#+DATE_CREATED~ (for sorting based on date) front matter.

#+BEGIN_SRC
#+TITLE: My File
#+FIRN_ORDER: 3
#+END_SRC

Please note that if there are gaps in your ~#+FIRN_ORDER~ values across files,
adjacent files will not work.

* Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
; render a list of the previous and next file.
; this determines the Next/Previous file based on FIRN_ORDER
(render :adjacent-files)

; Renders Next/Previous file based on date created.
(render :adjacent-files {:sort-by :date})

; Changes the html output for "previous" and "next" text:
(render :adjacent-files {:next-text "Newer post: "
                         :prev-text "Older post: "})
#+END_SRC
