* Overview

When you create a new Firn site for the first time, it will create a folder:
=_firn/layouts=. The layout folder stores Clojure files (=.clj=) that are
responsible for how your org-file is rendered to-html; The act of "applying" a
template means to pass the content of the org-file through a specific [[https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup][clojure hiccup]]
template that organizes how the content is displayed.

When an org-mode file is processed by Firn it looks for the in-buffer-setting (or what might be called "[[file:front-matter.org][Front Matter]]")
~#+FIRN_LAYOUT:~ to see if it uses a Layout. If none are specified, the _default
template_ is used.

* A simple layout file

Let's consider a simple layout file:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure

(defn default                   ; define a clojure func
  [{:keys [build-url title render partials]}] ; destructured commonly used functions and data
  (let [{:keys [head]} partials]              ; Ignore for now, partials will be explained later
    [:html                      ; => opens a `html` tag
     (head build-url)           ; => Renders the `head` partial
     [:body                     ; => opens a `body` tag
      [:main                    ; => Ditto
       [:article.def-wrapper    ; => opens a `article` html tag with a class of `def-wrapper`
        [:div.def-content       ; => see above
         [:h1 title]            ; => renders an `h1` tag with the file title.
         (render :file) ;       ; => `render` is where the magic happens!
         ]]]]]))                ; => all these closing brackets can be thought of as closing html tags (for now)
#+END_SRC

The above may look a little strange if you are not familiar with Clojure. The
next document will expand on what the ~render~ function does.

Your layout files *can have several functions* in them, but the *last function in the
file* is the one that is loaded as your layout.

* Partials

In the example above you may have noticed the ~partials~ binding appear. Partials
are similar to layouts: they are clojure functions that render html. Partials
are used for rendering particularly common pieces of html that might be shared
across several layouts (such as the ~head~ of your HTML document as in the example
above).

Using partials requires the following:

1. Create a partial in the ~partials~ directory.
   - A partial must be a clojure function, just the same as a layout file.
   - The *last function* in your partial file /is the partial that is applied/.
2. ~partials~ are a map of all the partial functions and is passed into layouts
   when they are rendered:
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
    (defn default
      [{:keys [partials]}] ; `partials` is a a map.
    #+END_SRC
3. You can optionally bind the partials you need in a let block so that they are
   easily callable as functions. The name of your partial is the name of the
   partial file. For example, the docs you are reading has a ~partials/head.clj~ file, and is accessible like so:

   #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
    (defn default                   ; define a clojure func
      [{:keys [partials]}]          ; destructure the `partials` key.
      (let [{:keys [head]} partials]
          [:html                      ; => opens a `html` tag
          (head build-url)            ; => Renders the `head` partial
          ; ....
   #+END_SRC
