* Overview

To use Firn, you will need to add some "Front Matter" to your org-files. Front
Matter is common in many static-site-generators. Firn uses org-mode [[https://orgmode.org/manual/In_002dbuffer-Settings.html][in-buffer-settings]] to set Front Matter.

Currently, Firn requires that each file it processes at least have a ~#+TITLE:~
front-matter key value.

* Firn Front Matter

The following front-matter are processed by Firn and/or made available to
layouts for processing.

| Key                | Type          | Purpose                                                 |
|--------------------+---------------+---------------------------------------------------------|
| ~#+TITLE:~           | string        | Required: Used in site-map, links, etc                  |
| ~#+DATE_CREATED~     | org-mode-date | File date created                                       |
| ~#+DATE_UPDATED~     | org-mode-date | File last updated                                       |
| ~#+FIRN_TAGS~        | list          | Creates [[file:firn_tags.org][file based tags]].                                |
| ~#+FIRN_PROPERTIES?~ | boolean       | Whether to render properties under all headings         |
| ~#+FIRN_TOC~         | map           | Settings for any rendered table of contents             |
| ~#+FIRN_FOLD~        | map           | Fold headings of a specified level: ex: {3 true 4 true} |
| ~#+FIRN_ORDER~       | integer       | Enables sorting files in the site-map                   |
| ~#+FIRN_PRIVATE~     | boolean       | Whether or not to read the file in question             |
| ~#+FIRN_SITEMAP?~    | boolean       | Whether to include the file in the site-map.            |
| ~#+FIRN_UNDER~       | list          | Categories for which the documents falls under          |

Changing some of these values from file to file will result in your files being
rendered differently. Meanwhile, you can set the default values for certain
front-matter in your ~config.edn~ file, as detailed in the [[file:configuration.org][configuration document]].

Let's consider an example - we will enable headline [[file:folding.org][folding]] in a document.


#+BEGIN_SRC
#+FIRN_FOLD {1 true 2 true}
#+END_SRC

The above will result in *all* level 3 and 4 headings being /folded/. If you would
like to render a certain file so that all level 1 headings (and no others) are
folded, you could do by overriding the ~:firn-fold~ value in your config in your
front matter by setting ~#+FIRN_FOLD: {1 true}~

In this case, ~FIRN_FOLD~ actually takes a *clojure value* (in this case, a map)
that is *evaluated* when your site is built.

* Custom Front Matter                                            :advanced:

All front matter will be accessible as metadata when it comes time to render
your layouts. That is to say, you can create your own custom keywords in your
files, and use them in your layouts. To access your front-matter, you will have
to dig into the data structure of your "file" in your layout. These keywords are *not* read in as Clojure values - they will be available just as strings.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(defn project
  [{:keys [meta]}]
  (let [my-keywords (-> meta :keywords)]
    [:html [:body (str my-keywords)]]))
#+END_SRC
